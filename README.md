# PSY6422 Data Visualisation and Management Project

Personal Well-Being within the UK since 2016 to the current time. 

This project aims to visualize personal well-being data from different countries within the UK, and to further allow you to select different years from which to look at this data. The aim of my visualizations were to look at the fluctuation of personal well-being across UK countries over recent years. And to further see which countries appear to have higher levels of personal well-being, and those with lower personal well-being. 

Based on the visualizations produced, Northern Ireland appears to have the highest personal well-being scores from 2016 to the current date. Furthermore, personal well-being fluctuated over the years, dependent on the specific personal well-being measure.
