# PSY6422 Data Visualisation and Management Project

Personal Well-Being in the UK from 2016-2021. 

This project visualizes personal well-being data from different UK countries, allowing you to look at how it has fluctuated from the year 2016 to 2021. This visualization further aims to highlight which countries have higher levels of personal well-being. As well as those with lower personal well-being, and therefore possibly in need of interventions to improve this. Based on the visualizations produced, Northern Ireland appears to have the highest personal well-being scores from 2016 to the current date. Furthermore, personal well-being fluctuated over the years, dependent on the specific personal well-being measure.
