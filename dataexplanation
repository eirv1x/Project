Uses of personal well being data:
>overall monitoring of national well-being
>use in the policy-making process
>international comparisons
>allowing individuals to make informed decisions about their lifes

The large sample sizes of APS datasets allow for comparisons between different sub-groups of the population and between different areas within the UK e.g., countries + regions. This is helpful for policy makers to target areas/groups with the highest need in terms of personal well-being. 

QUESTION SCORES = an 11-point scale from '0' ("not at all") and '10' ("completely")

Thresholds - used to present dispersion in the data.
for the life satisfaction, worthwhile, and happiness questions, ratings are grouped in the following way:
0-4 = low
5-6 = medium
7-8 = high
9-10 = very high
for anxiety questions, ratings are grouped differently to reflect the fact that higher anxiety is associated with lower personal well-being:
0-1 = very low 
2-3 = low 
4-5 = medium
6-10 = high

IDEAS:

--> potentially use click() to distinguish thresholds for pwb
